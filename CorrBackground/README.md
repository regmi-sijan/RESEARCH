This folder section have codes that uses combinatorial background to get background (both combinatorial and correlated background). Initial commit by Sijan Regmi on Sept 1, 2024.

The second commit on Dec 26 2024 is for "HistBothRange.C" to get new update to account for newer update for correlated background. As of today this will be still in testing phase and may not work.
