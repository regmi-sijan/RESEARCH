"Fun4All_RunPi0ClusterAna.C" is useful macro to make "ntuple" for truthparticle and "truthinfo_run7.sh" along with 'truthinfo_run.job' are associated shell script and condor jobs. 

Once, we make n-tuple then to make inavriant mass we will use "run_loop_truth.sh" and "run_loop_truth.job".

"RESULTS" folder has all ntuples and "loop_results" has the histogram for invariant mass.
