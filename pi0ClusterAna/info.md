This code although has name for pi0, but is universal for all truth particles. It can take hijing and embedded particles (any number and any kinds). Committed at 10 Feb 2025 is the code for generating ntuples only.

There are two modes to generate ntuples, one will take care of all generations of secondary particles but until photon, electron and positron is reached. 

Second mode is only to save photon, electron and positron for secondary particles. 

Both mode saves information about primary particles.
